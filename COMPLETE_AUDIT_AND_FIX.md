## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### üî¥ ISSUE #1: AI Creator Not on Homepage
**Problem**: The AI Creator section is showing on product pages, NOT on the homepage

**WHY**: In Shopify theme customizer, the "AI Creator Workflow" section is:
- Added to: Product Template
- NOT added to: Homepage

**FIX**:
1. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Online Store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Customize
2. Make sure you're viewing the HOMEPAGE (not a product page)
3. Click "Add Section"
4. Find "AI Creator Workflow"
5. Add it to the TOP of your homepage
6. REMOVE it from product pages if you don't want it there
7. Save

---

### üî¥ ISSUE #2: Missing REPLICATE_API_TOKEN in Vercel
**Problem**: The API can't generate images without this token

**CHECK**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mkyoung23s-projects/all-dogs-rock-api-v2/settings/environment-variables
2. Look for `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` in the list
3. If it's NOT there, add it:
   - Name: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: `[USE YOUR REPLICATE TOKEN - the one you provided starting with r8_1yPzc...]`
   - Check all 3 environments (Production, Preview, Development)
4. After adding, click "Redeploy" latest deployment

---

### üî¥ ISSUE #3: Multiple Conflicting Projects
**Problem**: You have duplicate Vercel projects and GitHub repos causing confusion

**CLEANUP PLAN**:

#### DELETE These Vercel Projects:
1. ‚ùå all-dogs-rock-api (duplicate)
2. ‚ùå all-dogs-rock-proxy (old, using wrong API)

**How to delete**:
1. Go to each project settings
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Click "Delete Project"
4. Confirm

#### CHECK This GitHub Repo:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ymcmb232324-4AllTheDogs-Rome/all-dogs-rock-proxy
2. Check if ANY Vercel project is connected to it
3. If nothing is connected, DELETE this repo (it's just causing confusion)

---

### üî¥ ISSUE #4: Shopify Calling Wrong Endpoint (MAYBE FIXED?)
**Status**: Your current code shows it's calling the CORRECT endpoint:
```
https://all-dogs-rock-api-v2.vercel.app/app-proxy/generate
```

**BUT VERIFY**:
Open browser console on your site (F12 ‚Üí Console) and check:
- Does it say: "API: https://all-dogs-rock-api-v2.vercel.app/app-proxy/generate"?
- OR does it say something else?

If it says something else, you need to update the Shopify code.

---

### üî¥ ISSUE #5: Image Generation Not Preserving Pet Identity
**Possible Causes**:
1. ‚ùå REPLICATE_API_TOKEN not set in Vercel (check Issue #2)
2. ‚ùå Shopify code sending wrong data format
3. ‚ùå Vercel function has errors

**TESTING STEPS**:
1. Open www.alldogsrockshop.com
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
3. Try generating an image
4. Look for RED errors in console
5. Copy the EXACT error message and tell me
