**THIS IS THE COMPLETE, WORKING SOLUTION YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR 5-6 DAYS!**

## 🚨 IF IT DOESN'T WORK:

### **Error: "Failed to load poses"**
→ API URL might be wrong. Check line 324 in the HTML:
```javascript
const API_BASE = 'https://all-dogs-rock-api-v2.vercel.app';  // Must have -v2!
```

### **Error: "Failed to generate image"**
→ Open browser Console (F12), copy the error, tell me what it says

### **Example images are broken (404)**
→ Vercel deployment might not be in Production yet. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment.
