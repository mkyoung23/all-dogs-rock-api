# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS - OCTOBER 31, 2025

## CRITICAL: You MUST promote the CORRECT deployment!

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Vercel Deployments**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/mkyoung23s-projects/all-dogs-rock-api-v2/deployments

2. **Find the NEWEST Deployment**
   - Look for the VERY TOP deployment in the list
   - It should be from commit: `fix: Force fresh FLUX deployment for production`
   - Branch: `claude/online-store-planning-011CUeAhybwWGj8dcMimZ9Ag`
   - Time: Just now (within last 2 minutes)

3. **Promote to Production**
   - Click the **"‚ãÆ"** (three dots) menu on that deployment
   - Click **"Promote to Production"**
   - Wait 30 seconds for DNS to update

4. **Verify It's Working**
   - The deployment URL should change to: `all-dogs-rock-api-v2.vercel.app` (without random characters)
   - The "Production" label should appear on that deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

‚ùå **DON'T** promote multiple deployments
‚ùå **DON'T** promote an old deployment
‚ùå **DON'T** click "Redeploy" - just promote the newest one
‚ùå **DON'T** promote anything that says "SDXL" in the commit message

‚úÖ **DO** promote only the NEWEST deployment (top of the list)
‚úÖ **DO** wait 30 seconds after promoting
‚úÖ **DO** test on www.alldogsrockshop.com after promoting

---

## üß™ TESTING AFTER PROMOTION:

1. Go to: www.alldogsrockshop.com
2. Upload a dog photo
3. Enter prompt: **"as a basketball player dunking a basketball"**
4. Click "Generate My Custom Image! ‚ú®"
5. Wait ~90 seconds (FLUX takes longer than SDXL)

**Expected Result:**
- 2 high-quality FLUX images displayed side-by-side
- Images actually look like your uploaded dog (80-90% match)
- Images actually show basketball dunking (not just standing)
- Click-to-select functionality works
- Selected image preview appears
- Product grid appears below

## üîç HOW TO CHECK IF YOU PROMOTED THE RIGHT ONE:

After promoting, go to your live site and open browser console:
- You should see: `üöÄ Generating images with FLUX img2img...`
- You should NOT see any 404 errors
- The API should respond with status 200 (after ~90 seconds)

If you see 404 errors, you promoted the wrong deployment. Go back and promote the NEWEST one.
