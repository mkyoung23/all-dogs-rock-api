## üß™ HOW TO TEST (DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Open the Customer Flow

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `https://all-dogs-rock-api-v2.vercel.app/api/customer-flow`
3. You should see the "üêï Create Your Custom Pet Portrait" page

### Step 2: Test the Complete Flow

1. **Click "Continue ‚Üí"** on the How It Works page
2. **Upload a dog photo:**
   - Click the upload area OR drag a photo
   - Upload 1-3 clear photos of a dog (or you with your dog)
   - If you're in the photo with your dog, check "My photo includes a person"
3. **Click "Continue ‚Üí"**
4. **Write a prompt:**
   - Either type your own OR click an example chip
   - Example: "my dog as a superhero flying over the city"
5. **Click "Generate Images ‚Üí"**
6. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for the AI to generate
7. **Choose your favorite image** (click on it)
8. **Click "Continue to Products ‚Üí"**

### Step 3: Check the Results

**CRITICAL TESTS:**

‚úÖ Does the generated image look like YOUR uploaded dog?
‚úÖ Or is it still generating random dogs?

**Open your browser console** (F12 or Right Click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab):
- Look for logs showing the API call
- Check for any errors
- Take a screenshot if there are issues

## üêõ If It's NOT Working

### If you get an error during generation:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for the error message
3. Check if it says:
   - "Replicate API token not configured" ‚Üí Environment variable missing
   - "Failed to start image generation" ‚Üí API issue
   - Other error ‚Üí Send me the exact error text

### If the generated image is still a RANDOM dog (not your dog):

This means the uploaded image isn't being sent correctly. Check:

1. Browser console for the API call
2. Look for the log: "Calling API with:"
3. Check "Image size: X characters" - should be large (>10,000)
4. If image size is small or missing, there's an upload issue

### If you can't access the URL at all (403 error):

1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Make sure the branch is deployed to production
3. Check deployment protection settings in Vercel

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing Works

### 1. Integrate with Shopify Homepage

Add a button/link to your homepage that goes to:
```
https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/apps/adrs/create
```

### 2. Integrate Product Selection

Replace the placeholder product grid with actual Customily product pages.

In `api/app-proxy/create.js`, update the `selectProduct()` function around line 850:

```javascript
function selectProduct(productType) {
  // Store the selected image in session/local storage
  localStorage.setItem('adrs_custom_image', state.selectedImage);

  // Redirect to actual product page with Customily
  const productPages = {
    'canvas': 'https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/products/custom-canvas',
    'mug': 'https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/products/custom-mug',
    'tshirt': 'https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/products/custom-tshirt',
    'phone': 'https://YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com/products/custom-phone-case'
  };

  window.location.href = productPages[productType];
}
```

### 3. Add HD Upsell

Add the HD upgrade checkbox before the "Continue to Products" button. Update the cart integration to include the HD product when checked.

## üìä Cost Estimate

Each image generation costs:
- **Standard quality:** ~$0.02-$0.03
- **Premium/HD quality:** ~$0.04-$0.05

With Replicate pay-as-you-go billing.

- `/api/app-proxy/create.js` - Shopify app proxy version

## üöÄ Deployment Status

All changes are committed to branch:
```
claude/online-store-planning-011CUeAhybwWGj8dcMimZ9Ag
```

And pushed to your repository. Vercel should auto-deploy within 2 minutes.

## ‚ùì Questions?

Test the flow first, then let me know:

1. ‚úÖ Does the flow work smoothly?
2. ‚úÖ Does the generated image look like your uploaded dog?
3. ‚ùå Any errors or issues?
4. üé® Any design changes you want?

---

**THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST:** Upload a photo of a SPECIFIC dog with unique features (breed, coloring, markings), generate an image, and verify the result looks like THAT dog, not a random dog.

If it works, your pet identity preservation problem is SOLVED! üéâ
