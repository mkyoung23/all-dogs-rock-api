## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

### Step 1: Promote Latest Deployment to Production

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/mkyoung23s-projects/all-dogs-rock-api-v2/deployments
2. Find the **NEWEST** deployment (should say "feat: Add complete 2-image FLUX selection UI")
3. Click the **"⋮" menu** (three dots)
4. Click **"Promote to Production"**
5. Wait 30 seconds

### Step 2: Update Shopify Theme Code

**The file `shopify-ai-creator-UPDATED.liquid` now has all the necessary code.**

**To update your Shopify theme:**

1. Go to: https://8k5mna-5e.myshopify.com/admin/themes
2. Click **"Customize"** on your active theme
3. Find the **"Custom Liquid"** section in your homepage
4. **Delete ALL the old code** in that section
5. Open the file: `/home/user/all-dogs-rock-api/shopify-ai-creator-UPDATED.liquid`
6. Copy **EVERYTHING** from `<div id="aiCreatorApp">` to `</script>` (STOP before `{% schema %}`)
7. Paste it into the Custom Liquid section
8. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Test on Your Live Site

1. Go to: www.alldogsrockshop.com
2. Upload a dog photo
3. Enter prompt: **"as a basketball player dunking a basketball"**
4. Click "Generate My Custom Image! ✨"
5. **Wait ~90 seconds** (FLUX takes longer but quality is worth it!)

### Step 4: What You Should See

**After generation completes:**
- 🎨 **2 amazing FLUX-generated images** side-by-side
- ✨ **Much better likeness** to your actual dog
- 🏀 **Actually shows basketball dunking** (not just standing there!)
- 👆 **Click your favorite** - it gets a green "✓ Selected" badge
- 🖼️ **Selected image preview** appears below
- 🛍️ **Products grid** shows where your image will appear

## 🎯 EXPECTED QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:

| Feature | Before (SDXL) | After (FLUX) |

| **Prompt Following** | Poor | Excellent ✅ |
| **Image Quality** | Good | Professional ✅ |

## 🔧 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK:

### Issue: Still getting 404 error
**Solution:** You didn't promote the latest deployment. Go back to Step 1.

### Issue: Only seeing 1 image instead of 2
**Solution:** You didn't update the Shopify code. Go back to Step 2.

### Issue: Images don't look like the dog
**Solution:** Test with a clear, well-lit photo of your dog's face. FLUX needs good reference images.

### Issue: Generation taking forever
**Solution:** FLUX takes 60-90 seconds. Be patient! Quality takes time.

## 💰 COST BREAKDOWN:

- **Per Generation:** $0.17 (2 FLUX images)
- **100 generations/day:** $17/day = $510/month
- **500 generations/day:** $85/day = $2,550/month

**This is WORTH IT** because customers will actually get images that look like their dog!

1. **api/app-proxy/generate.js** - FLUX model integration
